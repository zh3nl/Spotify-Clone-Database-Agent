# üß™ Idempotency Testing Guide

This guide will help you test the enhanced Database Agent to ensure it correctly handles repeated queries without creating duplicate resources.

## üöÄ Overview of Idempotency Enhancements

The Database Agent now includes:
- **State-aware analysis**: Tracks existing tables, APIs, and components
- **Smart operation filtering**: Skips redundant operations
- **Idempotent SQL generation**: Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses
- **Query intent recognition**: Detects requests for existing features
- **Operation history tracking**: Maintains record of completed operations

## üîß Test Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following environment variables set:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key  # or OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### 2. Install Supabase Functions
First, run the Supabase functions setup:
```bash
# Copy the SQL to your Supabase SQL Editor
cat cli/utils/supabase-functions.sql
```

### 3. Clear Previous State (Optional)
If you want to start fresh:
```bash
# Remove state cache files
rm -f .db-agent-state.json
rm -f .db-agent-history.json

# Clear migration files (optional)
rm -rf src/lib/migrations/*
```

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Idempotency - Recently Played Songs

**Objective**: Verify that asking for the same feature multiple times doesn't create duplicates.

**Steps**:
1. Run the first query:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "Can you store the recently played songs in a table?"
   ```
   
2. Note the output and files created
3. Run the **exact same query** again:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "Can you store the recently played songs in a table?"
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- First run: Creates migration files, API routes, updates components
- Second run: Should detect existing functionality and skip operations
- You should see messages like:
  ```
  ‚úÖ Recently played functionality is already implemented!
  ‚úÖ Table: recently_played
  ‚úÖ API: /api/recently-played
  No operations needed - all requested functionality already exists! üéâ
  ```

### Test 2: Partial Implementation Detection

**Objective**: Test detection when only some components exist.

**Steps**:
1. Manually create a table (simulate partial implementation):
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS recently_played (id UUID PRIMARY KEY);
   ```
   
2. Run the query:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "Can you store the recently played songs in a table?"
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- Should detect existing table
- Should still create missing API routes and components
- Should skip table creation operation

### Test 3: Different Phrasings, Same Feature

**Objective**: Test intent recognition with different phrasings.

**Steps**:
1. Run initial query:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "Can you store the recently played songs in a table?"
   ```
   
2. Run with different phrasing:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "I want to track recent songs that users have played"
   ```
   
3. Try another variation:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "Create a recently played functionality"
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- All variations should be recognized as the same feature
- Should skip operations after first implementation

### Test 4: Multiple Features in Sequence

**Objective**: Test idempotency across different features.

**Steps**:
1. Implement recently played:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "Can you store the recently played songs in a table?"
   ```
   
2. Implement popular albums:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "Can you create a popular albums feature?"
   ```
   
3. Re-run recently played:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "Can you store the recently played songs in a table?"
   ```
   
4. Re-run popular albums:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "Can you create a popular albums feature?"
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- Steps 1 & 2: Should create new functionality
- Steps 3 & 4: Should detect existing functionality and skip

### Test 5: State Recovery After Restart

**Objective**: Test that state persists across CLI sessions.

**Steps**:
1. Run a query to create functionality:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "Can you store the recently played songs in a table?"
   ```
   
2. Exit the CLI completely
3. Start a new CLI session and run the same query:
   ```bash
   npm run db-agent
   # Enter: "Can you store the recently played songs in a table?"
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- State should be recovered from cache files
- Should detect existing functionality immediately

## üìä Monitoring and Validation

### Check System State
You can check the current system state using:
```bash
npm run db-agent
# Enter: "status" or "show state"
```

### View Operation History
Check the operation history:
```bash
cat .db-agent-history.json
```

### Check Migration Status
```bash
npm run db-agent:migrations
```

### Validate Database State
Check your Supabase dashboard to verify:
- Tables exist with correct schema
- Migrations are recorded in `_db_agent_migrations`
- RLS policies are applied correctly

## üîç Key Indicators of Success

### ‚úÖ Successful Idempotency
- **Recognition Messages**: "Feature already implemented"
- **Skip Messages**: "No operations needed"
- **No Duplicate Files**: Same migration files aren't created twice
- **No Database Errors**: No "already exists" errors from database
- **Fast Execution**: Subsequent runs complete quickly

### ‚ùå Failed Idempotency
- **Duplicate Files**: New migration files created each time
- **Database Errors**: "table already exists" errors
- **Slow Execution**: Every run takes full time to complete
- **Resource Duplication**: Multiple identical API routes or components

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: State Not Detected
**Solution**: Check if state cache files exist and are readable:
```bash
ls -la .db-agent-state.json .db-agent-history.json
```

### Issue: Database Connection Problems
**Solution**: Verify environment variables and Supabase functions:
```bash
# Check environment
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
echo $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

# Test connection
npm run db-agent:test-connection
```

### Issue: SQL Not Idempotent
**Solution**: Check generated SQL contains `IF NOT EXISTS`:
```bash
# Check latest migration file
cat src/lib/migrations/latest-migration.sql | grep -i "if not exists"
```

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance
- **First run**: 10-30 seconds (full implementation)
- **Subsequent runs**: 2-5 seconds (state detection only)
- **State cache hit**: < 1 second (if cache is fresh)

### Cache Validity
- State cache is valid for 5 minutes
- After 5 minutes, system re-analyzes project state
- Force refresh with `--force-refresh` flag

## üîÑ Continuous Testing

### Automated Testing Script
Create a test script to run multiple scenarios:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-idempotency.sh

echo "Testing idempotency..."

# Test 1: Basic idempotency
echo "Test 1: Basic idempotency"
echo "Can you store the recently played songs in a table?" | npm run db-agent
echo "Can you store the recently played songs in a table?" | npm run db-agent

# Test 2: Different phrasing
echo "Test 2: Different phrasing"
echo "I want to track recent songs" | npm run db-agent

# Test 3: Popular albums
echo "Test 3: Popular albums"
echo "Can you create a popular albums feature?" | npm run db-agent
echo "Can you create a popular albums feature?" | npm run db-agent

echo "Idempotency tests completed!"
```

## üìã Test Checklist

Use this checklist to verify idempotency:

- [ ] **State Detection**: System detects existing tables/APIs/components
- [ ] **Operation Skipping**: Redundant operations are skipped
- [ ] **SQL Idempotency**: Generated SQL uses `IF NOT EXISTS`
- [ ] **Intent Recognition**: Different phrasings recognized as same feature
- [ ] **Performance**: Subsequent runs are significantly faster
- [ ] **No Duplicates**: No duplicate migration files or API routes
- [ ] **Database Safety**: No "already exists" errors from database
- [ ] **State Persistence**: State survives CLI restarts
